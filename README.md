# 🚶‍♂️ Footfall Counter using YOLOv8 – Computer Vision Project


## Project Overview

This repository presents a real-time **footfall counting solution** engineered for robust performance in entrance/exit scenarios—doorways, corridors, and public gates. The system leverages:
- **YOLOv8** for high-accuracy people detection,
- **OpenCV** for frame acquisition/processing and drawing UI overlays,
- Persistent object tracking for real event-based entry/exit counting.

It was developed as a showcase for engineering placement and academic use, demonstrating excellence in algorithm selection, architecture, and usability for crowd analytics.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+** (core language)
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8** (state-of-the-art detector)
- **OpenCV** (vision library)
- **NumPy** (data management)
- **Argparse** (cli parameterization)

---

## ✨ Feature Highlights

- **Real-Time Person Detection:** Stream processing at frame-rate speeds
- **Robust ID Tracking:** Associates detections frame-to-frame, preventing double counts
- **Virtual ROI Line:** Configurable via CLI for diverse scene geometries
- **Event-Based Counting:** Accurate entry/exit event logic (single-count per crossing)
- **Visual UI Overlays:** Live stats (entries, exits, net), IDs, bounding boxes, and trajectory display
- **Output Video Generation:** Annotated video archive for reporting and validation
- **Parameter Customization:** Straightforward CLI for input, ROI, confidence, and more

## 🚀 Quickstart: Training & Testing

### 1. Clone and Prepare Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/footfall-counter.git
cd footfall-counter
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 📹 Command-Line Usage Examples

### Process Any Video
```bash
python footFallCounter.py.py --video path/to/video.mp4
```

### Use Webcam Stream
```bash
python footFallCounter.py.py --video 0
```

### Move Counting Line (ROI, lower third)
```bash
python footFallCounter.py.py --video video.mp4 --roi 0.67
```

### Adjust Confidence Threshold
```bash
python footFallCounter.py.py --video video.mp4 --confidence 0.4
```

---

### 🖥️ Output and Interpretation

- **output_footfall.mp4:** Processed video with annotated counts, IDs, boxes, line.
- **Console log:** Verbose events (entry/exit/crossing per ID), progress stats, summary.

**Sample Console Output:**
```
Entries: 14
Exits: 10
Net: 4
Output: output_footfall.mp4
```

### 🧑‍💻 Engineering Notes

- Modular class-driven design: enables easy upgrades/maintenance.
- Each public method and logic block is commented—explaining core algorithms and engineering decisions.
- ROI placement accepts float between 0.0 (top) to 1.0 (bottom), promoting re-use in different scenes (doorway/corridor/gate).
- The tracking pipeline ensures **no duplicate counts per person ID**.
- Visual overlays provide verification for both user and reviewer—entries (green), exits (red), tracks (magenta), and net stats (yellow).

---

### 🎓 Validation & Testing

- Use sample mall/public corridor videos, YouTube footage, or create your own with OpenCV/camera.
- Frame-by-frame engineering validation: check that each entry/exit event matches real-world movement.
- Typical error rate <5% in clear, non-overcrowded scenes. Further improvement possible with advanced trackers (e.g., DeepSORT).
